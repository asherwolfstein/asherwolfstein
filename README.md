# Asher Wolfstein

> That's not the point. The point is, who will stop me?

I am Asher Kadar Wolfstein. I like to think—a lot. I write and code. I enjoy being myself and acting like me. I use a lot of words. No plans. Just coffee & strangeness. For more see [asherwolfstein.com](https://asherwolfstein.com)

I am a [Radical Individualist](https://radicalindividualism.org), who communicates honestly in everything. If you don't want to answer or engage, I expect *you* to say so and not engage further; to me, any other behavior is suspicious. Respect being equal, I will personally (not publicly) leave you and your space alone. None of that is an excuse for mean, malicious, or aggressive behavior on my part. I coined the term [phenomic freedom](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/User:Gmork7/Phenomic_freedom) in 2005. Phenomic freedom, which is derived from an individual’s right to self-ownership, is relevant to individuals who wish to modify their bodies, especially in appearance, such as cyborgs or transsexuals.

<summary>I am concerned with, focused on, and interested in the following…</summary>

- Fully realizing my identity, potential, and capabilities as a biological human striving to transcend limitations.
- Discussing my ideas productively and effectively. I am not interested in ‘arguing,’ grandstanding, vitriol, negativity, abuse, manipulation, verbal violence, or (Internet-)’drama,’ though the discussion may be dramatic.
Individual rights and everything related to the definition and protection of said rights in practice and politically from those who wish to infringe, abuse, or eliminate them. They are the source of my political positions, including laissez-faire capitalism.
- In social or ‘societal’ terms, the ‘Other’ refers to those stigmatized or marginalized by those considered ‘mainstream’ or socially ‘acceptable’ due to various influential factors. I take the Other to mean anyone in any group prone to being ostracized or dismissed. I am deeply interested in the Other, including the ideas they entertain, the things they do, and the underappreciated potential improvements they make to living.
- Intersections of computer science, literature, art, history, culture, philosophy, science, psychology, consciousness, technology, interactive media, and the Internet. To find these intersections, I am interested in each subject to varying degrees, but my most significant interests are philosophy and computer science.
- Proactively improving situations involving topics that interest me, such as philosophy, computer science, culture, capitalism, and mental health care, as an individual. This generally consists of conducting ‘socially progressive’ for-profit business activities, heading up organizations dedicated to creative and intellectual endeavors with an emphasis on the Other (see above), and authoring/publishing ‘open-source’ software and other written materials. These materials are generally permissively licensed.
